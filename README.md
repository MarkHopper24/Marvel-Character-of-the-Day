Danny is always focused yet relaxed - more Zen-focused than chill surfer dude. But when Danny turns into Iron First, he becomes very rigid with perfect posture. A very Yin/Yang character. 

Danny is THE Danny Rand â€“ the 17-year-old head of the giant Rand Corporation.  His wealth rivals Osbornâ€™s â€“ but youâ€™d never know it from his laid- back attitude. However, as Iron Fist, he takes his powers very seriously. 

While Danny and Luke are best friends, Danny has a special respect for Spider-Man, acting as a non-judgmental moral commentator on all of Spider-Manâ€™s actions. 

**First Appearance:** Ultimate Spider-Man Infinite Digital Comic (2015) #18

<h2>What is this repository?</h2>
Marvel Character of the Day is a PowerShell-based application hosted in GitHub that provides information about a different Marvel character each day. The repository picks a random character daily @ 5am UTC.

<h3>Features</h3>
- <b>Daily Marvel Character Information:</b> Fetches and displays information about a random Marvel character every day from Marvel's official API.

- <b>Automated Scripts:</b> Uses PowerShell scripts and GitHub Workflow Actions to automate the process of retrieving and displaying character data.
  
- <b>Friendly JSON Endpoint:</b> Offers an easily retrievable endpoint containing a JSON file with the Daily Character information. You can find this here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkHopper24/Marvel-Character-of-the-Day/refs/heads/main/MarvelCharacterOfTheDay.json
  
- <b>TRMNL Integration:</b> Offers markdown templates for usage with [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com). To use this data for a plugin, you can either:
    1. Create a custom plugin with the polling strategy pointing to the JSON endpoint above. Copy the contents of the files in the .\templates folder to your plugin's markdown, and you're done.
    2. One-click install as a [Plugin recipe](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10122094-plugin-recipes).
