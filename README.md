Richard fenster first appeared driving Hercules to the UCLA campus to deliver a lecture on the genealogies of the Olympian Gods that Fenster had booked him for. While in transit to the campus Hercules and Fenster a raging forest fire along the Pacific Coast Highway. The fire was on the verge of getting out of control so Hercules immediately leapt into the fire and rescued the fire-fighters and then uprooted a giant redwood to use against the encroaching flames. Used the giant redwood to beat back the flames and then he made a firewall of scorched ground and the giant redwood to isolate and contain the fire to end the danger.
