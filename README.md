<h2>What is this repository?</h2>
Marvel Character of the Day is a PowerShell-based application hosted in GitHub that provides information about a different Marvel character each day. 

<h3>Features</h3>
- <b>Daily Marvel Character Information:</b> Fetches and displays information about a random Marvel character every day from Marvel's official API.

- <b>Automated Scripts:</b> Uses PowerShell scripts and GitHub Workflow Actions to automate the process of retrieving and displaying character data.
  
- <b>Friendly JSON Endpoint:</b> Offers an easily retrievable endpoint containing a JSON file with the Daily Character information. You can find this here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkHopper24/Marvel-Character-of-the-Day/refs/heads/main/MarvelHeroOfTheDay.json
  
- <b>TRMNL Integration:</b> Offers markdown templates for usage with [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com). To use this data, create a custom plugin with the polling strategy pointing to the JSON endpoint above. Copy the contents of the trmnlLayout.html file to your markdown, and you're done. TRML recipe coming soon.
