  "Description": "As the Norse God of thunder and lightning, Thor wields one of the greatest weapons ever made, the enchanted hammer Mjolnir. While others have described Thor as an over-muscled, oafish imbecile, he's quite smart and compassionate.  He's self-assured, and he would never, ever stop fighting for a worthwhile cause.",
